# minicoap
[cantcoap](https://github.com/staropram/cantcoap)-based [ESP8266 Andruino](https://github.com/esp8266/Arduino) library implementing [CoAP](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7252) server for the [SemIoT project](https://github.com/semiotproject).

## Description

miniCoAP library is based on [cantcoap](https://github.com/staropram/cantcoap) to decoding and encoding messages.

Unlike the [microcoap](https://github.com/1248/microcoap) library, which is focusing on the smallest memory footprint for microcontrollers,
miniCoAP library focusing on full CoAP protocol support.

## Supported platforms

### ESP8266
Using [Arduino](https://github.com/esp8266/Arduino) libraries.


## Features

`Will be described later`

+ Resources creation (inheriting the `CoAPResource` class)
+ Subscriptions support (Observe CoAP option)
+ Sleeping nodes
+ Resource directory cache
+ Basic auth
+ Hydra-based self-descripting API with JSON-LD semantic descriptions
